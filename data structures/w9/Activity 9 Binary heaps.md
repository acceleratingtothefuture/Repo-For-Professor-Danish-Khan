# Activity 9 Binary heaps

Video explanation: 

## 1: Draw what the following heap would look like after we insert the value 11 into it:

11 is added where it has to be. Then is successively promoted to the top since it is the highest. 

## 2. Draw what the previous heap would look like after we delete the root node.

NOTE: This is assuming we didn't insert 11. 

The last node (furthest right of the bottom row) is popped off to replace the root node. Then each highest parent higher than it switches with it until the rule of children being less than parents always holds. 

## 3. Imagine youâ€™ve built a brand-new heap by inserting the following numbers into the heap in this particular order: 55, 22, 34, 10, 2, 99, 68. If you then pop them from the heap one at a time and insert the numbers into a new array, in what order would the numbers now appear?

It's just in descending order {99, 68, 55, 34, 22, 10, 2}.

Consider two facts:

1. The delete function always grabs the root node.
2. The root node must always be the node of highest value.

Therfore, successive deletion will delete items in descending order.
