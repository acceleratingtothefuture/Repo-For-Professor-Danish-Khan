Video explanation: 

## Task 1: "Use Big O Notation to describe the time complexity of an algorithm that takes 4N + 16 steps"

O(N). "According to the rules of Big O notations, the notation ignores constants and numbers that are not an exponent...if you have a function running time of 5N, we say that this function runs on the order of the big O of N. This is because the constant five no longer matters as N gets large‚Äù

If we zoom out to visibly see n and 4n + 16, as both are visible, higher order things like n squared are vertical and lower order things like 1 are flat.

## Task 2: Use Big O Notation to describe the time complexity of an algorithm that takes 2N<sup>2</sup> 

O(N<sup>2</sup>). Again. We drop the constant and look at the highest order variable.
