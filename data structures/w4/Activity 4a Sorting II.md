# Activity 4a: Sorting II

Video explanation: 

## Task 1: "Proof that, under the average-case scenario, the insertion sort has a time complexity of O(N<sup>2<sup>). Draw a clear figure and show all the operations clearly. "


## Task 2: "How many steps would binary search take for the previous example?"



## Task 3: "What is the maximum number of steps it would take to perform a binary search on an array of size 100,000?"



## Task 4: "Write a C++ code that implements the linear and binary search algorithms. The algorithm should be able to calculate the number of steps against the given search." 

```c++
```
